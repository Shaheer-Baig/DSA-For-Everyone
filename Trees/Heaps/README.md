# Heap in Data Structure

A **heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property:

- **Max-Heap**: Every parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.
- **Min-Heap**: Every parent node is smaller than or equal to its child nodes.

A heap is typically implemented using an array, where:
- The root is at index `0`.
- For a node at index `i`:
  - Its left child is at index `2i + 1`.
  - Its right child is at index `2i + 2`.
  - Its parent is at index `(i - 1) / 2`.

## Importance of Heaps

### Efficient Priority Management
Heaps are used to implement **priority queues**, where the element with the highest or lowest priority is efficiently extracted.

### Fast Access to Extremes
- **Max-Heap**: Access the maximum element in **O(1)**.
- **Min-Heap**: Access the minimum element in **O(1)**.

### Sorting
- The **Heapsort** algorithm sorts an array in **O(n log n)** time using a heap.

### Memory Management
- Used by some memory allocators to manage free memory blocks.

### Graph Algorithms
- Used in algorithms like **Dijkstra's** and **Prim's** to retrieve the smallest or largest element efficiently.

## Applications of Heaps

### Priority Queues
- Scheduling tasks in operating systems.
- Network packet scheduling.

### Graph Algorithms
- **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm**.
- **Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm**.

### Heapsort Algorithm
- A sorting algorithm that uses a heap to sort elements efficiently.

### Median Finding
- Using two heaps (a max-heap and a min-heap) to find the **median** of a data stream efficiently.

### Event Simulation
- Managing event scheduling in simulations.

## Types of Heaps

### 1. Max-Heap

#### Definition
- The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
- The **largest element** is at the root.

#### Operations
- **Insertion**:
  - Add the element at the end of the heap and then "bubble it up" (swap with its parent if greater).
  - **Time Complexity**: **O(log n)**.
- **Deletion**:
  - Replace the root with the last element and "heapify" down (adjust the heap to maintain the property).
  - **Time Complexity**: **O(log n)**.

#### Use Cases
- Finding the **kth largest** elements in an array.
- Implementation of priority queues where the highest priority is the largest value.

---

### 2. Min-Heap

#### Definition
- The value of each node is smaller than or equal to the values of its children.
- The **smallest element** is at the root.

#### Operations
- **Insertion**:
  - Add the element at the end and "bubble it up" (swap with its parent if smaller).
  - **Time Complexity**: **O(log n)**.
- **Deletion**:
  - Replace the root with the last element and "heapify" down.
  - **Time Complexity**: **O(log n)**.

#### Use Cases
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** (finding shortest paths).
- Scheduling algorithms where the smallest priority is processed first.

### 3. Binomial Heap

#### Definition
- A collection of binomial trees satisfying the heap property.
- Supports fast **merging** of heaps.

#### Use Cases
- Advanced **priority queue operations**.

---

### 4. Fibonacci Heap

#### Definition
- A collection of trees that are more flexible than binomial heaps.
- **Decrease-Key** operation is **O(1) amortized**.
- **Merge** operation is **O(1) amortized**.

#### Use Cases
- Advanced **graph algorithms** (e.g., **Dijkstra’s** and **Prim’s**) for better efficiency.

---

### 5. Binary Heap

#### Definition
- A **complete binary tree** (all levels are filled except possibly the last one, filled from left to right).
- Most common type of heap.

#### Use Cases
- Implementing **priority queues**.
- **Heapsort** algorithm.

---

### 6. Pairing Heap

#### Definition
- A simpler structure than Fibonacci heaps but with comparable performance for many operations.

#### Use Cases
- **Priority queues** where **decrease-key operations** are common.

## Heap vs Other Data Structures

| Feature       | Heap       | Array      | BST (Balanced) |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Search**   | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(log n)      |
| **Insert**   | O(log n)  | O(1) (append) | O(log n) |
| **Delete (max/min)** | O(log n) | O(n) | O(log n) |
| **Space**    | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(n) |

Heaps are a cornerstone for **efficient algorithm design** and **problem-solving** due to their **simplicity** and **versatility**. Understanding their operations and variations is crucial for tackling **optimization** and **priority-related challenges** effectively.
