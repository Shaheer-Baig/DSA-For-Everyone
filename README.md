# DSA-For-Everyone
A comprehensive collection of basic concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with clear explanations and code implementations. Perfect for beginners and those looking to strengthen their DSA fundamentals!
 # Content
 # Time Complexity
Explanation of different time complexities: Constant (O(1)), Logarithmic (O(log n)), Linear (O(n)), Quadratic (O(n²)), and more.
Understanding how time complexity impacts algorithm efficiency.
# Arrays
Basic and advanced operations on 1D and 2D arrays.
Efficient techniques for insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting.
# Linked Lists
Implementation of Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, and Circular Linked List.
Operations including insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
# Stacks
Array-based and linked list-based stack implementations.
Covers both finite and infinite stacks.
# Queues
Implementation of Linear Queue, Circular Queue, and Priority Queue.
Queue operations using arrays and linked lists.

Understanding dynamic and static vectors.
Implementation of multidimensional vectors.
# Recursion
Covers different types of recursion: tail recursion, non-tail recursion, and indirect recursion.
Practical examples and problem-solving techniques.
# Trees
Overview of Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and AVL Trees.
Common operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder).
# Graphs
Graph representation and traversal using BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search).
Implementation of Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path calculations.
# Hash Maps
Implementation of hash maps using techniques such as separate chaining, linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing
